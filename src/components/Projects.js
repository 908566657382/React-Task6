      <b>UAV Drone:</b>
      Project mainly focuses on the detection and alerting the respected authorities. Here we have mainly focused on preparing a UAV drone that can detect the four disaster events namely fire, flood, collapsed building, traffic accidents. So when a drone is flown through a particular area or region it captures the video footage of the area or region time to time by which in the backend it will run the ML algorithm for the detection and if any detected it will alert the respective departments such as fire – Fire responsive station, Flood – flood response force station, traffic – police and nearest hospital and collapsed building – calamity response team.
